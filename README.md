## Overview

This project implements a framework for 3D reconstruction using point clouds, leveraging different techniques such as LIDAR-based data processing, point cloud transformations, and visualization. It also explores various neural network architectures for feature extraction and reconstruction.

## Features

- **Point Cloud Processing**: Utilities for loading, processing, and transforming point clouds.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Implementations of 3D reconstruction techniques using neural networks and traditional methods.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing point clouds and reconstructed 3D models using Open3D.
- **Neural Network Models**: Integration with architectures such as MPVCNN2 for feature extraction and reconstruction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Open3D
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) CUDA for GPU acceleration

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youssefibrahimm/3D_recon_pc.git
cd 3D_recon_pc
```

### Install Dependencies

It is recommended to create a virtual environment first:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Preprocess the Point Cloud Data**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input_dir <path_to_point_cloud_data> --output_dir <path_to_save_processed_data>
   ```

2. **Train the Reconstruction Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --config configs/eval_config.yaml --checkpoint <path_to_checkpoint>
   ```

4. **Visualize the Results**:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py --input_dir <path_to_reconstructed_data>
   ```

### Configuration

Modify the configuration files in the `configs` directory to change hyperparameters, dataset paths, and other settings for training and evaluation.

## Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**: Load point cloud data from PLY or other supported formats.
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply transformations and filtering to clean and normalize the data.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Use neural network models such as MPVCNN2 to extract features from the point clouds.
4. **Reconstruction**: Reconstruct 3D models using the extracted features.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the reconstructed models using Open3D.

## Dataset

- The dataset should be structured as follows:
  ```
  ├── data/
      ├── raw/
      ├── processed/
  ```
- Place the raw point cloud files in the `data/raw/` directory.
- Processed data will be saved in the `data/processed/` directory.

## Results

- Include sample results here, with images and performance metrics.
- Visualizations of the original point clouds and the reconstructed 3D models.
